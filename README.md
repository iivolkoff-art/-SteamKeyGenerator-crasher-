# SteamKeyGenerator-crasher-

Okay, seriously, the program gives out a random combination of characters that imitates the steam key (DO NOT WORK). The essence of the program is different, after generating the second "key" it blocks the computer by turning off the monitor and blocking the keyboard and mouse. If you want to test the program, then there is an exe file in the release folder. The computer will have to be restarted to get it back up and running. The program is written for the purpose of entertainment.
